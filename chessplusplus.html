        How to play
    </h1>
    <p>Pawns (it looks like a bald) moves one tile forward basically, and can go two tiles if they never moved. If a piece diagonally facing pawn, and it is front-way, it can capture the piece.  It is a brave solder that doesn't know retreating, and bravely fights against other pawns. The pawns are as strong as other pawns, so they can't finish their battles until other pieces interrupts.</p>
    <p>Bishop (it look like got beaten by an axe on its head) moves and captures diagonally and infinitely. He is a royal sniper that never miss target, and moves unexpectabley. How amazing he is!</p>
    <p>Knights (it is JUST A HORSE) they go two tiles and turn 90 degrees and go a tile, so they moves like an L. and they can jump over pieces. He is useful for protecting and attacking multiple pieces, so he is often used for early game. </p>
    <p>Rooks (it's a castle) they move orthogonally and infinitely. he is a royal guard of the KING, so they are at the corner of the board. and they have special move, 'castling', makes rook move 2 or 3 tile to the king and king hides behind the castle, rook.</p>
    <p>Queen (it has crown) moves like a bishop and a rook mixed, so she is the most powerful piece in the chessboard. she is the ruler of chessboard, controls massive tiles, and took benefits of bishops and rooks  </p>
    <p>King (it looks like a jacket) can move to 8 tiles around him, and he is the most important piece in the chessboard. and he is a coward, so when he gets attacked, it's 'check'. when 'check', you have to move your king or protect the king from the threat. otherwise, your king dies and game overs.</p>
